//課題内容説明(バックグラウンド1個め)//
We will give a presentation on 
"Dose technology intensify human communication skills?"

---------------------------
//4Pバックグラウンド//
In today's rapidly changing society, 
I decided to focus on this topic because advances in technology
 are impacting human communication.

//5P意見//
In our opinion, three factors contribute to the improvement
 of communication skills due to technological advancements:

1,The ability to communicate with people who are far away.
2,Enhanced efficiency in language learning.
3,The evolution of language translation tools.

//6P離れた人とのコミュニケーション//
The ability to communicate with people
 who are far away means that in the past,
 the only way for people to communicate was by meeting in person. 
However, with the widespread adoption of the telephone,
 it became possible to have conversations with people who were far away.

//7P言語翻訳ツール//
The evolution of language translation tools means that,
 thanks to these tools, communication with people 
who speak languages I can't speak has become possible.

//8P効率的な学習//
Regarding the improvement in language learning efficiency, 
 with the current advancements in technology,
 it is now possible to engage in learning that involves conversations 
 with foreigners through online English lessons and learning materials.
 This allows for more efficient language learning,
 as it can be done at any time and place.


//9P結論//
In conclusion, technology contributes to the improvement of communication skills
 because communication through video calls and social media has become unavoidable.

Thank you for listening.
